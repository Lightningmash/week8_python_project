# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description
A Python-based data analysis notebook that tracks COVID-19 trends globally, focusing on key metrics like cases, deaths, and vaccinations for selected countries.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Load and clean real-world COVID-19 data
- Analyze time-based trends and cross-country comparisons
- Visualize data using line, bar, and choropleth maps
- Generate key insights and summary reports

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly.express (for optional choropleth map)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
1. Open the notebook `covid_tracker.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Ensure you are connected to the internet to load the dataset
3. Run all cells from top to bottom
4. All charts and insights will be rendered directly in the notebook

## ðŸ’¡ Insights & Reflections
- United States had the highest case count and early vaccination lead
- India's steep rise in cases in mid-2021 was notable
- Kenya maintained low case numbers but mirrored death rate trends
- Vaccination rollouts impacted death rate decline significantly
